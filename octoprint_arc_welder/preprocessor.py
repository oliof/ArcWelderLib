# Arc Welder: Anti-Stutter
#
# A plugin for OctoPrint that converts G0/G1 commands into G2/G3 commands where possible and ensures that the tool
# paths don't deviate by more than a predefined resolution.  This compresses the gcode file sice, and reduces reduces
# the number of gcodes per second sent to a 3D printer that supports arc commands (G2 G3)
